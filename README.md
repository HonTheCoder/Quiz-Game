🎮 Interactive Quiz App
This project is my final project for the subject Event-Driven Programming. It demonstrates how to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to build a responsive and interactive quiz game based on user actions and events.

🧠 Description
The Interactive Quiz App is a simple web-based game that tests the user's knowledge through 10 multiple-choice questions. It uses event-driven programming principles where the game responds to user interactions such as button clicks and selections.

Features:
🔄 10 Questions with 4 answer choices each.

🎯 Real-time feedback on answers ("Correct!" or "Wrong answer").

📊 Final score is displayed at the end of the game.

🎵 Sound effects:

Correct answer: success sound

Wrong answer: error sound

Background music during the game

Option to toggle background music ON/OFF from the main menu

⏱️ Timer feature.

🔁 Option to Restart the game or go back to the Main Menu.

🎯 Objective
To apply the core concepts of event-driven programming by creating a graphical quiz game that reacts to user input and updates the interface dynamically.

✅ Learning Outcomes Achieved
Implemented event handlers to react to user interactions.

Managed GUI components like buttons, labels, and score updates.

Dynamically updated the user interface based on events.

Used control structures (if/else, loops) in response to events.

🧩 How it Works
The user starts from the Main Menu.

The quiz displays one question at a time.

When the user selects an answer:

A sound plays based on correctness.

Feedback is shown ("Correct!" or "Wrong answer").

Score is updated.

The "Next" button shows the next question.

After 10 questions, the app shows the final score with options to Restart or return to Main Menu.
